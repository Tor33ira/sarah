    <p>Dear sara❤️,
        When I look at the Years we have been together,I do so with a smile on my face through all the ups and downs we have been through,the one thing that has remained constant is my love for you. 
        The love I feel for you has gone from wild and free to me enjoying the little things about you
        We have years ahead of us but when I look at the years that has passed my heart grows with such love for you that I ache. If I were to leave this earth tomorrow it would be with no regrets only with certainty that you are the person I was meant to be real nothing beside death will ever tear us apart. 
        Here to us; here is to our time together, here is to our love my love. HAPPY BIRTHDAY mysarah
        <span id="m1">I LOVE YOU ❤️</span> 
         </p>
